Yooooo!!! I will be adding the templates that I once made for my previous ML projects into this open-source repository
Don't Expect to have every shitty ML models that u see in Research Papers, I don't know much of the syntax myself,
but these basic templates that I had in my local repository were enough for many of the Kaggle competitions or ML hackathons that I was lookin into,
Use my templates for getting closure on the competitions, and of course make templates for yourself(you can take references from this)
Have Added Inter-IIT 2023 Model Architecture
HAPPY MACHINE LEARNING!!!
